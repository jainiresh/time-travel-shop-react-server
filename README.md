*This is a submission for the [DevCycle Feature Flag Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/devcycle): Feature Flag Funhouse*

## What I Built
Welcome to our Time-Traveling Music Store, where every visit takes you on a nostalgic journey through the decades. Leveraging a dynamic feature flag, the store adapts to showcase music from any chosen year, immersing you in an authentic experience of that era.

For example, select 1999 to explore the hits of the late '90s, accompanied by a website design reminiscent of that era’s retro aesthetics. If you choose 1945, the store transforms into a vintage interface, echoing the charm and style of mid-century design, while displaying iconic music from the time.

For modern-day enthusiasts, the experience updates with sleek and cutting-edge designs for 2023, 2024, and beyond, offering the latest tracks and an ultra-modern interface.

You can refresh the page or click a dedicated button to fetch new music from the year you’ve selected, keeping your musical exploration as dynamic as time itself.
